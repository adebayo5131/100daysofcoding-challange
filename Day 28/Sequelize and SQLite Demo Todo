This is a demo of  sequelize and sqlite from the classes I am taking on Udemy

Creating a Todo Demo using sequelize and sqlite3. This demo shows how sequelize and sqlite works. I learned how to create a basic list of to-do items and also how to fetch them

For sequelize documentation visit: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/…/installa…/getting-started.html

You will also need to download Database for SQLite. This helps you view all data and files you add.
visit:https://sqlitebrowser.org/

A demo can be ran using https://sqlitebrowser.org/
To add more Todo items to the file uncomment the TODO. create code and commented out the todo.findByid then
run code in your command line.

Remeber to install npm init and all the dependent files.
