Update: OpenWeather.org Requires An API Key (Free)

 it's free and easy to setup. Here are the instructions to follow during the next video to setup your API Key:

Step 1: Get API Key

You can get an API Key by registering for a free account on their signup page.

Once you login to your new account, you should see an API section on the page. Copy the API Key into the clipboard.

Step 2: Update URL

Anytime you use the API, all you need to do is add this API Key to the url. Currently the URL will look like this:

var url = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=' + encodedLocation + '&units=imperial';

After you add the API Key, it should look like like the following. Notice the appid query parameter was added. Will talk more about that soon!

var url = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?appid=PASTE_API_KEY_HERE&q=' + encodedLocation + '&units=imperial';

You will need to also install npm yargs so you can run the code.
